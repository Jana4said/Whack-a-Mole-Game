# ðŸŽ® Whack-a-Mole Game

A Whack-a-Mole-style interactive game built using **Java** and **Processing**.  
This project was developed as part of my **COMP 1405 (Introduction to Computer Science)** course to demonstrate event-driven programming and object-oriented design.

---

## Project Overview
Players must click on moles that appear randomly on the screen before they disappear.  
The game tracks the score and increases difficulty as the speed of mole appearance rises.

## Features
- Real-time rendering using Processing
- Randomized mole positioning
- Score tracking and performance feedback
- Smooth gameplay with event-driven logic
- Object-Oriented structure for easy modification

---

## Technologies Used
- **Java**
- **Processing**
- **OOP Principles (Encapsulation, Inheritance)**
- **Event-Driven Programming**
